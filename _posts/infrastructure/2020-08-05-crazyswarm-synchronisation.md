# ![favicon](/assets/images/favicon.jpg){: .aligned-left} Crazyswarm framework for synchronised flight

This tutorial is meant to cover trajectory following for bots on Unity3D at a basic level. The user will be able to input any kind of bot model and use C# to setup a custom trajectory as well as the necessary control code on the bot to follow this trajectory.

This tutorial is meant as a taster of bot design. It is achievable in under an hour and I invite you to go beyond and design more complex bot behaviours.

This tutorial is developed with advanced videogame developers in mind. A couple of independent videogame developers have reached out to develop drone behaviours within Unity3D, and this tutorial is somewhat a primer for trajectory generation and following.
