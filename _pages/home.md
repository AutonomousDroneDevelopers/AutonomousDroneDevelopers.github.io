<h2>Welcome.</h2>

We are an innovation laboratory in Paris.

We develop **drones** and **robotic** systems that make decisions autonomously.


<h2>Software.</h2>

<h2>We have a common software stack to create stable, responsive and creative behaviours.</h2>

{% include gallery id="gallery_software" layout="fourth" class="full" caption="" %}

<h2>Hardware.</h2>

<h2>We share a standard set of equipment for drone conception.</h2>

{% include gallery id="gallery_hardware" layout="fourth" class="full" caption="" %}

<h2>An interface.</h2>

<h2>We have developed virtual-to-real infrastructure to visualise robots in their environment.</h2>
