# Current work done on Arena

The Drone Arena is currently used in three separate domains:
- Drone Development
- Augmented Reality
- Drone Swarming

All the teams use the platform to test their projects.
For this purpose, multiple tools are currently being developed.

Note: Some of the latest work on the platform is still to be transfered here from Thomas Carstens's profile at the DVIC. [here](https://dvic.devinci.fr/resource/members/thomas_carstens/).
